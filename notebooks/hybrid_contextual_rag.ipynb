      "{'url': 'https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html', 'text': 'Founder Mode\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 2024\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said it was the best they\\'d ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time in his life, forgot to take notes. I\\'m not going to try to reproduce it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe theme of Brian\\'s talk was that the conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized as \"hire good people and give them room to do their jobs.\" He followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb\\'s free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe audience at this event included a lot of the most successful founders we\\'ve funded, and one after another said that the same thing had happened to them. They\\'d been given the same advice about how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping their companies, it had damaged them.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company you hadn\\'t founded — how to run a company if you\\'re merely a professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that managers can\\'t, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because it is.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from the dismay of founders who\\'ve tried it, and the success of their attempts to escape from it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode. Business schools don\\'t know it exists. All we have so far are the experiments of individual founders who\\'ve been figuring it out for themselves. But now that we know what we\\'re looking for, we can search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the ways it will differ.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular design in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as black boxes. You tell your direct reports what to do, and it\\'s up to them to figure out how. But you don\\'t get involved in the details of what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad.\\n\\n\\n\\nHire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great when it\\'s described that way, doesn\\'t it? Except in practice, judging from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne theme I noticed both in Brian\\'s talk and when talking to founders afterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they\\'re being gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they have to run their companies like managers, and by the people working for them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees with you, your default assumption should be that you\\'re mistaken. But this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven\\'t been founders themselves don\\'t know how founders should run companies, and C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world. [ 1 ]\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever founder mode consists of, it\\'s pretty clear that it\\'s going to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company only via his or her direct reports. \"Skip-level\" meetings will become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there\\'s a name for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge number of permutations to choose from.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he considered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were not the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the force of will it would take to do this at the average company? And yet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big company feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn\\'t have kept having these retreats if they didn\\'t work. But I\\'ve never heard of another company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We still don\\'t know. That\\'s how little we know about founder mode. [ 2 ]\\n\\n\\n\\nObviously founders can\\'t keep running a 2000 person company the way they ran it when it had 20. There\\'s going to have to be some amount of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp they are, will probably vary from company to company. They\\'ll even vary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn trust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode. But it will also work better. We already know that from the examples of individual founders groping their way toward it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndeed, another prediction I\\'ll make about founder mode is that once we figure out what it is, we\\'ll find that a number of individual founders were already most of the way there — except that in doing what they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse. [ 3 ]\\n\\n\\n\\nCuriously enough it\\'s an encouraging thought that we still know so little about founder mode. Look at what founders have achieved already, and yet they\\'ve achieved this against a headwind of bad advice. Imagine what they\\'ll do once we can tell them how to run their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n\\n[ 1 ] The more diplomatic way of phrasing this statement would be to say that experienced C-level execs are often very skilled at managing up. And I don\\'t think anyone with knowledge of this world would dispute that.\\n\\n\\n\\n[ 2 ] If the practice of having such retreats became so widespread that even mature companies dominated by politics started to do it, we could quantify the senescence of companies by the average depth on the org chart of those invited.\\n\\n\\n\\n[ 3 ] I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start misusing it. Founders who are unable to delegate even things they should will use founder mode as the excuse. Or managers who aren\\'t founders will decide they should try to act like founders. That may even work, to some extent, but the results will be messy when it doesn\\'t; the modular approach does at least limit the damage a bad CEO can do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThanks to Brian Chesky, Patrick Collison, Ron Conway, Jessica Livingston, Elon Musk, Ryan Petersen, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'}\n"

Suppose another multiple of three.\\n\\nThe chunk discusses the author\\'s realization that formal education, particularly school, often distorts the understanding of what constitutes \"real work,\" making it seem tedious and unappealing. The author reflects on the need to discover the true essence of work to develop a genuine passion for it, drawing on Hardy\\'s experience with mathematics as an example. This insight emphasizes that a deeper understanding of one\\'s field is essential for fostering a love for work, aligning with the document\\'s broader theme of the relationship between hard work, passion, and genuine interest in one\\'s pursuits.\\n\\nThat would make sense. Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious about work was probably school, which made work (what they called work) seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was before I could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, because even in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entire departments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of real work, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they\\'d been made for each other. I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they can love it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in A Mathematician\\'s Apology: I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively. He didn\\'t learn what math was really about till part way through college, when he read Jordan\\'s Cours d\\'analyse. I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what mathematics really meant.\\n\\nThe chunk discusses the economic rationale behind startups, emphasizing the intense effort and productivity of founders and skilled workers in a short timeframe compared to traditional corporate roles. It highlights how this compressed work model allows for greater financial rewards, particularly in technology, where efficiency and innovation are highly valued. This ties into the broader theme of the document, which contrasts the effective \"founder mode\" of running a company with the less effective \"manager mode,\" suggesting that founders can achieve significantly more by leveraging their unique skills and work ethic.\\n\\nThe Proposition\\n\\n\\n\\nEconomically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years.

It introduces the idea that startups allow individuals to accelerate their wealth creation by concentrating intense work into a shorter timeframe, contrasting this with the traditional long-term employment model. This sets the stage for the overall argument that startups represent a unique opportunity to generate significant wealth through innovation and hard work, as discussed throughout the document.\\n\\nA startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem. Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don\\'t have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small? Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it grows larger? And why do they so often work on developing new technology? Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?
